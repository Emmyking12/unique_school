        <p style="text-align: left;"> It is highly important to start on this note that UNIQUE SCHOOL is a great project
            from and in the hand of the
            almighty God. Travelling down the memory lane, I can vividly recall one faithful morning, some decades ago,
            precisely 1989, sitting in a blue Volkswagen belonging to the then REV. S. A Ilutanmi, a life changing
            revelation was released through the spirit of the Almighty God to me, then Mr. but now the very REV.
            Ebenezer
            Adekunle Ajiboye, that I would own a school. I voiced the wonderful message immediately as it was precise,
            important and direct.

            Being on a very meager salary as an N.C.E. 1982 teacher, I was all out to improve my academics status. I
            struggle to obtain my B.A. Education in 1987 and Post Graduate Diploma in Public Administration in 1987. The
            vision was abandon for a time, to look for more paid job in Lagos. My hope was dashed when an uncle told me
            to
            take teaching job in Lagos, the vocation I wanted to quit at Ife because of poor remuneration. However it
            was
            the hand of God in my inability to secure a higher envied job in a merchant bank. As usual every month after
            taking the so called salary of about #275.00, I would travel to Lagos with a cousin, a pharmacist who was on
            a
            business trip and come back on my own since he must have finished his own business transaction before me. I
            returned very late to Ife around 1:00am, getting down from the bus I boarded, I hit my chin against a covet
            and
            the spirit came back to remind me of the vision in the language which I clearly understood: “what you are
            looking for is in your pocket.” I ruminated much on the meaning of the statement that came in a gentle way.
            From
            that day, I decided not to look for job again but started teaching /learning aids to purse the vision of
            being a
            school manager because God is the proprietor- the Senior Partner.

            The preparation took me to Childhood department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, University of Ibadan
            and
            UNILAG. I also visited U.I. bookshop to select titles that would make me start and build according to the
            revelation given. I prepared to quit Odudua College but finance was a big issue. How do I mean? Getting a
            place
            to use a temporary site was not easy as we in Ile-Ife were eagerly expecting Ile-Ife to be made the capital
            of
            Osun State capital. As the lord would have it, a man of God REV. Lanre Williams could quickly observe my
            ordeal,
            he directed us to an estate film at Lagere. We had the favor of God and man to occupy an estate of about
            eight
            flat with the agreement to pay the one we could afford. Getting to Number 60 Oranfe Street, Ile-Ife, we knew
            that God had really reserved the place for unique. So on Monday 14th October 1991 , the school, UNIQUE
            started
            full operation with 26 lucky boys and girls it was really tough for me and my better half because she would
            join
            us organizing things and even teaching a class before going for afternoon duty as a Nurse. We told parent to
            keep their hand bills distributed in July/August 1991 to be check on us in case we deviate. To God be the
            glory,
            of recent, a copy of document was found</p>
        <span>and our slogan then is still our hallmark : “Unique school where services is at its best”.

            In 1993, the school moved to a storey building of four flat belonging to Late Prince Saliu Oriade of blessed
            memory. The school tarried a little there probably because of the modern facilities available but at God’s
            time we moved to the permanent site I 1998; though the school purchased the parcel of land in 1992. The
            school started with a rickety rackety station wagon Peugeot with registration number OG 200T. It is on
            record that Unique school started with such brand of vehicle and other ‘unconventional’ approach to
            teaching/learning situation. Parent kept asking for Unique where good things were happening despite the fact
            that no signpost was erected. God and the standard kept selling the school even till today. To God be the
            glory.

            At a God given time, Unique minds international college came into being in September 2000. From inception
            till date, our hallmark has been “Diligence and Excellence”. It is our belief that no child is write-off
            because Unique is in existence to bring our Uniqueness God has created with each individual. Every child,
            parent, and teacher is important to us in Unique so we work together as one Unique family, achieving God’s
            purpose in the Nigerian child to His benefits and to the betterment of our community and Nigeria as a whole.

            Of a truth, there is no rose without thorns. Indeed a lot of water has pass under the bridge. The school, no
            doubt, has passed through some challenges, periods of ups and downs, but His faithfulness, grace and mercy
            have kept us this far. Though we are not there yet, the good news is we are not too far from getting there

            The past 26 years in spite of the challenges confronting the nation’s educational sector and the economy,
            God has proved himself faithful. Even in the face of stiff oppositions and unhealthy rivalry and
            competitions from other schools, the school has been able to withstand the test of time and stand tall
            amidst her peers

            Penultimately, if we are to count our blessing and name them one by one, time and space would not permit us.
            However permit me to mention some of the laudable, mouth-gaping achievements recorded so far by the school.
            Top on the list is the outstanding performance of our pupils/students all over the years academically and
            morally. Excellent performance in programmers organized locally, nationally and intentionally.

            Second on the list is the rate at which our student have been gaining admissions into reputable tertiary
            institution both in the country and abroad. The excellent performance of our pupils/students in various
            Nigerian Universities and oversees speaks for our justifiable existence and also brilliant performance of
            our student both in WAEC and NECO

            Third, the follow-ups statistics on the performance of our students in the various tertiary institutions of
            learning across the country has been outstanding as evident from one of our students who recently graduated
            from university of Jos, Department of applied Mathematics, with first class Honors.

            Also, for the past decade, our student have been excelling in extra-curricular activities and other national
            competitions, quiz and debate, cultural dances competitions such as those organized by space Centre, just to
            mention few. Above all, all round development to produce complete, well informed and good Nigerian leaders
            forms our core focus on a daily basis.

            In conclusion, I want to appreciate the almighty God, the giver, sustainer and actualize of the vision for
            the journey so far. I also extend my heart of gratitude to all the teachers, friends, parents, guidance and
            loco parentis and well-wishers, who have and who are contributing immensely to the fulfillment of this God’s
            given vision.

            God bless Unique Group of Schools, God bless the State of Osun and the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</span>
